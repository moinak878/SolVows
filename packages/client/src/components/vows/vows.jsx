        I choose you and promise to choose you as my partner every day we wake.
        I will love you in word and deed. I will laugh with you, cry with you,
        scream with you, grow with you, and craft with you. To be your kin and
        your partner in all of life's adventures is all I could hope for in the
        world. Loving what I know of you and trusting what I don't yet know, I
        give you my hand. I give you my love. I give you myself, the good, the
        bad, and the yet to come. You love me in love and complete me in ways I
        never knew possible. From this day forth, I promise to listen to you and
        learn from you, to support you and accept your support. I will celebrate
        your successes and mourn your losses as though they were my own. I will
        love you, my partner, and rejoice in your love for me for all of the
        years of our lives.
