        Marriages are made in heaven, but the ring exchange can now even happen
        in digital tokens or Blockchain on Earth. Couples can now exchange NFTs
        (non-fungible tokens) as virtual rings using smartphones during their
        wedding ceremony. NFTs allow people to buy and sell ownership of unique
        digital items and keep track of who owns them using the Blockchain. NFT
        stands for “non-fungible token,” and it can technically contain anything
        digital, including drawings, tweets, animated GIFs, songs or even video
        games.
